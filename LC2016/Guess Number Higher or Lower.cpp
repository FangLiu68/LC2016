 We are playing the Guess Game, the game is as follows:
 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
 
 You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
 -1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
 
 Example:
 n = 10, I pick 6.
 Return 6.
